Add versioned OpenKey authorization protocol (v1) types and consumer wiring.

- `sdk-core` exports `TinyCloudAuthorizationRequestV1`, `TinyCloudAuthorizationResultV1`, `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1`, `validateAuthorizationResultV1`, `isPlausibleOpenKeyActionId`, `OPENKEY_ACTION_ID_SEPARATOR`.
- `sdk-core` also exports narrowing-verification helpers `extractImmutableSiweFields`, `diffImmutableSiweFields`, `extractRecapAttenuations`, `unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` (with `ImmutableSiweFields` and `RecapAttenuation` types) so consumers can prove that a widget-signed SIWE is a strict narrowing of the SDK's original prepared SIWE.
- `node-sdk` adds `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult()` which completes the session with the exact `signedMessage` the OpenKey widget returned (not the caller's original prepared SIWE). Its `prepared` argument now REQUIRES `siwe` (the SDK-generated reference SIWE). Validates that the signature verifies against the returned bytes, that the recovered signer matches the local signer, that every immutable SIWE header field (domain, address, URI, version, chainId, nonce, issuedAt) is preserved byte-for-byte, that the ReCap capability set is a subset of the original request, and that `selectedActionKeys` are covered by that set. `statement` is not part of the immutable set because it is a human-readable rendering of the ReCap and must be allowed to change when the ReCap is narrowed.
- `cli` browser-auth advertises `protocolVersion=1` on the /delegate URL, validates every callback payload before persisting (including structural checks on the optional `permissions[]` array), and (when the response includes effective `permissions`) refuses any grant that broadens the requested set.
- `sdk-core.unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` now enforces STRICT caveat subsetting: child caveats must exist by deep-equality in the parent's caveat set. Removing all caveats (broadening from "restricted" to "unrestricted"), replacing a caveat with a different one, and adding incompatible caveat alternatives are all rejected. Empty parent caveats still means unrestricted (child is free to add restrictions).
- `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` now enforces stricter selectedActionKeys/permissions consistency: `selectedActionKeys` must cover every non-required capability in `signedMessage`; every returned `permissions` entry action must appear in `signedMessage`; broader `permissions` entries are rejected; empty `permissions[]` with a capability-bearing SIWE is rejected; duplicate `selectedActionKeys` entries are rejected; and the resource-substring fallback used to resolve permission entries has been replaced with a canonical two-form resolver (space or space+path) that fails on ambiguity.
- `node-sdk` adds `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKey(authorizeFn, opts)` — the production entry point that wires `prepareSessionForSigning` → OpenKey `authorizeTinyCloud()` → `signInWithOpenKeyResult` into one call. Callers provide a thin `authorizeFn` bridge to the OpenKey SDK; the node-sdk enforces every subset/immutable-field invariant before creating any session state.
- `cli.parseDelegationExpiryField` numeric-seconds test fixture corrected (was passing `4_071_849_600` = Jan 11 2099, but expected Jan 1 2099 = `4_070_908_800`).
