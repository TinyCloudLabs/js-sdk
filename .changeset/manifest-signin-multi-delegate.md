Wire manifest-driven `signIn` and multi-resource `delegateTo` end-to-end (closes the two gaps in `2.1.0-beta.1`).

`signIn` now reads `config.manifest` and resolves it (via `resolveManifest` + the new `manifestAbilitiesUnion`) into the WASM `abilities` map used by `prepareSession`. The resulting SIWE recap covers the union of the app's own permissions AND every manifest-declared delegation's permissions, so the session key acquires coverage for both runtime use and downstream sub-delegations in one wallet prompt. Apps that don't pass a manifest fall back to `defaultActions` (legacy behaviour, no change).

`delegateTo(did, permissions)` no longer rejects multi-entry input. The SDK now folds every `(service, path, actions)` entry into a single multi-resource abilities map and calls the WASM `createDelegation` once — producing ONE signed UCAN whose `attenuation` carries every grant. The returned `PortableDelegation` has the new optional `resources?: DelegatedResource[]` field listing the full breakdown; the legacy flat `path` + `actions` fields mirror the first (sorted) resource for back-compat.

Listen-style apps that needed to delegate KV + SQL on the same prefix to a backend can now do so in a single `tcw.delegateTo(backendDID, [...])` call with no wallet prompt.

**Breaking changes** — pre-2.1.0-beta.2 callers will need to update:

- `@tinycloud/sdk-core`: `CreateDelegationWasmParams` swaps `path: string; actions: string[]` for `abilities: Record<string, Record<string, string[]>>`. `CreateDelegationWasmResult` swaps the flat `path` + `actions` for `resources: DelegatedResource[]`. New exports: `DelegatedResource`, `AbilitiesMap`, `manifestAbilitiesUnion`, `resourceCapabilitiesToAbilitiesMap`.
- `@tinycloud/node-sdk`: `TinyCloudNodeConfig` gains an optional `manifest?: Manifest` field. `TinyCloudNode` gains `setManifest(manifest)` and `manifest` getter passthroughs to the underlying auth handler. `delegateTo` no longer throws on multi-entry input — apps that relied on that behaviour for validation must add their own length check. `PortableDelegation` gains an optional `resources?: DelegatedResource[]` field.
- `@tinycloud/web-sdk`: `TinyCloudWeb.setManifest()` now forwards the new manifest into the underlying `TinyCloudNode` so the next `signIn()` picks it up. `BrowserWasmBindings.createDelegation` signature aligned with the new WASM ABI.
- `@tinycloud/node-sdk-wasm` / `@tinycloud/web-sdk-wasm`: the `createDelegation` WASM export takes `abilities: object` (multi-resource map) instead of `path: string, actions: string[]`. The Rust rev in `packages/sdk-rs/Cargo.toml` is bumped to the merge commit of the `feat/create-delegation-multi-resource` PR in `tinycloud-node`.
