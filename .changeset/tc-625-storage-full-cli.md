TC-625: Every command and tool reports full TinyCloud storage the same way.

- CLI: a write refused because storage is full (`STORAGE_QUOTA_EXCEEDED`) or too small for the write (`STORAGE_LIMIT_REACHED`) exits with the new code 10 (`ExitCode.STORAGE_FULL`) from every command, including `kv`, `sql`, `duckdb`, `vars`, `vault`, `secrets`, `account` and `share`. It prints one message, `TinyCloud storage is full; nothing was written.`, with a hint that gives the account totals when the SDK reports them (`371.7 MiB used of 100 MiB (free plan)`), says reading still works, and links to https://account.tinycloud.xyz/billing. It never shows the per-space limit or the switch-hosts network hint. `tc sql copy` that fills storage part-way keeps its progress instead (`Insert into "notes" failed after 2 row(s): TinyCloud storage is full.`). The node's storage text is read only from an uncoded 402 or 413 response; an error with another code, such as a local `ENOENT`, keeps its own mapping. Behaviour change: `tc kv put` exited 1 and `tc share` exited 4 for a full space; both now exit 10. `tc share` keeps 8 for `UNSAFE_FILENAME`/`OUTPUT_EXISTS` and 9 for notify partial failure. `tc share` reports a write larger than the remaining storage as `STORAGE_LIMIT_REACHED` instead of `UPLOAD_FAILED`.
- Operations and MCP: a new `STORAGE_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` operation error code with `retryable: false`. The message says nothing was written, reading still works and the owner must free up space or upgrade; `details.account` carries the account totals when known. Behaviour change: a KV write on full storage was a retryable `NODE_ERROR`, and a SQL write was `SQL_EXECUTION_FAILED` with an unknown outcome.
- VFS: a write on full storage fails with `ENOSPC` instead of `EIO`.
