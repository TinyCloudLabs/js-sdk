# @tinycloud/operations

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7ecd455: Add bounded, byte-safe TinyCloud KV CRUD operations to MCP, including metadata reads, tagged content writes, create/replace/upsert modes, optimistic concurrency with ETags, and conditional deletion.
- 7ecd455: Add exact-database delegated SQLite schema inspection, parser-approved bounded read queries, and explicitly acknowledged parameterized DML execution to the canonical operations and MCP surfaces. SQL requests now forward hard row and byte limits where applicable and encode BLOB parameters byte-exactly.

### Patch Changes

- @tinycloud/node-sdk@2.8.0
- @tinycloud/sdk-core@2.8.0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1269a58: Add canonical delegated account-space, application, and generic non-secrets KV exploration operations. Publish the beta MCP package with four corresponding read-only tools and a documented exact request, owner grant, import, restart, and retry workflow. Allow a fresh delegate profile to bootstrap from its first request-bound delegation while preserving canonical import validation.
- 2721f9d: Add the experimental operations package foundation and depend on its exact prerelease from the CLI.
- abe8083: Implement the canonical `tinycloud.secrets.get` operation and route `tc secrets get` through it while preserving Commander rendering and owner authorization behavior.
- 1c73181: Add the public `@tinycloud/operations/artifacts` authority and v1 permission-artifact APIs.

### Patch Changes

- 492a656: Bind request-bound delegation imports to the selected profile host before activation, including legacy hostless portable delegations.
- 5172cf9: Reject persisted profiles whose posture conflicts with their authentication method so delegated sessions cannot enter local owner authentication.
- 5c32147: Add the I5 Commander coverage ledger and deterministic registration check,
  cross-surface canonical-envelope fixtures, generated coverage references,
  source-boundary checks, and Node 20 packed-artifact conformance gates. MCP
  publication remains deferred while the SDK v2 beta gate is `unpublishable-defer`.
- a5b557a: Resolve explicit-key secret spaces against the authenticated owner and keep
  local-owner acquisition and its single retry on one live runtime session.
- f5b1c75: Repair I2 release artifacts: bundle ESM-only multiformats dependencies for Node CommonJS consumers, preserve safe delegation mismatch details, and publish the canonical CLI auth import route.
- 39cc055: Register the reviewed I2 status and authentication operations and publish their deterministic catalog metadata.
- b982b90: Declare Node 20 or newer as the supported runtime floor for the complete published SDK and Operations graph, including the CLI and Node WASM bindings.
- 96b9e21: Require explicit owner-profile opt-in for authenticated operations, harden exact delegation request/import handling, and expose verified base-session authority to canonical auth operations.
- 160c16e: Canonicalize JSON object keys using RFC 8785 raw UTF-16 code-unit ordering,
  including astral-plane keys. Update operations' exact sdk-core dependency at
  release so retry digests use the corrected canonicalization.
- c62f72a: Add the experimental delegated stdio MCP projection with generated operation
  schemas, pinned startup profile selection, canonical structured envelopes, and
  the packaged delegated-secrets workflow. Expose the existing operations-owned
  profile-name resolver needed to pin a projection process before stdio starts.
