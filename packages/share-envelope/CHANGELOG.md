# @tinycloud/share-envelope

## 1.0.0-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- 2e9db6e: Owner-only (email-addressed) Share links published by the CLI now open in the Share viewer, and CLI `--to domain:` shares now work. The CLI commits the recipient's mailbox credential in the policy (Policy/v2) and publishes the owner's node location record before publishing.
  - `publishAddressedShare` refuses an exact-email share without a credential requirement bound to the address. Previously such a share was signed as Policy/v1, which no receiver accepts.
  - The new `addressedCredentialRequirement(target)` builds the commitment for email and email-domain targets.
  - The new `prepareAddressedShare(request)` runs every target, recipient, filename and action check, with no side effects. The CLI calls it before publishing the location record or uploading, so a refused share (for example `--to domain:… --action edit`) leaves nothing behind.
  - `notifyShare` matches, keys and delivers on the canonical mailbox, so `tc share publish --to email:Foo@x.com --notify` and `tc share notify --to Foo@x.com` invite `foo@x.com`. The CLI canonicalizes `--to` mailboxes and domains up front, and an invalid one reports the specific reason.
  - A location registry outage during `tc share publish` (network error, 5xx, 408 or 429) reports `UNAVAILABLE` (exit 4) with a retry hint. A registry rejection (any other 4xx, or an invalid record) reports `REGISTRY_REJECTED` (exit 6) and says that retrying will not help. sdk-core throws the new `LocationRegistryHttpError`, which carries the HTTP `status`, for registry HTTP failures; the message text is unchanged.
  - `canonicalMailbox`, `canonicalEmailDomain`, `isCanonicalEmailDomain` and `mailboxBelongsToDomain` now live in `@tinycloud/share-envelope`. `@tinycloud/sdk-core` re-exports them unchanged.

## 1.0.0-beta.4

### Major Changes

- b852650: Seal Policy/v3 recipient metadata as the canonical AES-256-GCM
  `version || nonce || ciphertext+tag` blob before constructing an addressed
  share link. Delivery authorization now binds that sealed blob and its
  fragment-only key, rather than accepting a plaintext `?tc2` envelope. Remove
  the public plaintext Policy/v3 inline URL codec; only sealed fragment links
  are accepted for addressed shares. Add the reusable app-neutral
  OpenCredentials invitation client and bind notification retries to the signed
  delivery JTI/nonce used by Node and OpenCredentials deduplication.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Major Changes

- c690844: Complete the TC-498/TC-500 native-sharing beta cutover. The legacy
  broker-backed Share APIs, link/transport compatibility paths, and retired CLI
  Share flags are intentionally removed. Use owner-Node native bearer
  delegations or signed Policy/v3 addressed shares; this release does not retain
  a parallel legacy broker authority plane.

## 0.2.1-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 026bf15: Ship browser-safe compact-UCAN verification and canonical embedded-policy delivery/receive with holder-bound delegation through generic `/delegate` and `/invoke`, without Node `/share/*`.

## 0.2.1-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- dc92402: Use the browser-safe base64url codec when verifying compact UCAN roots, even when the host bundle exposes a partial `Buffer` polyfill.

## 0.2.1-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- b0069f7: Add first-class accountless share receiving with session-key credential binding, strict PolicyCredentialPresentation/v4 admission, ordinary delegation invocation, and post-render private import into `files-for-you`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9fd8752: Establish the canonical browser- and Node-safe Share envelope codecs and headless SDK foundation. Tracks TC-401's receiveShare parity contract.

### Patch Changes

- 4ce36a6: Add typed recipient-DID/device authorization, exact-email and domain policy publication/claim resume seams, idempotent notification outcomes, encrypted sender history views, target-aware revocation, and explicit read-only tc1 migration helpers to the canonical Share SDK and CLI.
- 7805213: Publish the TC-405 v3 delegation envelope and SDK together under fresh beta
  versions so consumers cannot resolve the stale `share-envelope@0.2.0-beta.0`
  artifact that predates the v3 APIs. Derive installed runtime-delegation
  provenance from signed UCAN authority and accept the node's canonical padded
  Base64 decrypt-response fields.

## 0.2.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- 7805213: Publish the TC-405 v3 delegation envelope and SDK together under fresh beta
  versions so consumers cannot resolve the stale `share-envelope@0.2.0-beta.0`
  artifact that predates the v3 APIs. Derive installed runtime-delegation
  provenance from signed UCAN authority and accept the node's canonical padded
  Base64 decrypt-response fields.
